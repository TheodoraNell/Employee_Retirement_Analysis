# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview: 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.
## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
##Summary: 
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
  1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
        **72,458 employees eligible for retirment. **create table with roles of all other employees
  3. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
        **mentorship_titles table, more than enough retirement-ready employees to mentor those eligible. However, there are no employees with the title "Manager" that are eligible for mentorship and 2 employees of retiring age with that title. **non_retiring_managers table is incorrect because not all  managers are shown as department managers so one table shows 7 managers while pulling managers from the other_employees table shows 18 ** There are 18 other current employees in the company with a "Manager" title. All were born between 1955 and 1965 putting them "between" the two groups. There is an area of opportunity to possibly promote 2 employees from the pool of mentorship-eligible candidates to the title of "Manager" or to expand the mentorship program to include some the the "between" employees since there are so many of retiring age. 
  4. **Average salaries of retiring employees vs whole company/mentorship candidates

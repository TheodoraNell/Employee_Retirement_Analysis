# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview: 
The purpose of this analysis is to explore and consolidate a group of CSV files containing different employee and company information for a large corporation. More specifically, it aims to understand the scope and implications of having a large number of employees who are approaching or at retirement age.
## Results: 
- **Employees of retirement age**:

    This table shows all employees that were born between 1952 to 1955. However, the same employee number is referenced more than once for employees who have had more than one title within the company.

- **Distinct Employee list**:

    This table removes the duplicate rows and only shows the most recent title for each employee.

## Summary: 
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

     72,458 employees eligible for retirment and there will need to be a plan in place to fill or transform their roles.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

     For reference, another table was created showing the number of mentorship candidates by title:

     As can be seen by comparing the two tables, there more than enough retirement-ready employees to mentor those eligible. However, there are no employees with the title "Manager" that are eligible for mentorship and 2 employees of retiring age with that title. 
     
- However there are 18 other current employees in the company with a "Manager" title. 
    All were born between 1955 and 1965 putting them "between" the two groups. There is an area of opportunity to possibly promote 2 employees from the pool of mentorship-eligible candidates to Management or to expand the mentorship program to include some the the "between" employees since there are so many of retiring age.
